  about: `
Hey there! I'm Virti Jain — a full-stack dev from Gujarat.  

I love building cool, responsive web apps with the MERN stack & Next.js. Python’s in my toolkit too, mostly for DSA, and I’m exploring AI & Generative AI.  
Turning ideas into reality with clean code, neat UI/UX, and speedy apps is my jam. Problem-solving, learning new stuff, and creating projects that actually matter keep me going. 
Always on the lookout for exciting projects where I can grow, learn, and build awesome things!
